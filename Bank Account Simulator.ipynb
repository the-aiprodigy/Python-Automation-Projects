    "This project involves creating a simple bank account application in Python that demonstrates the use of custom exceptions for error handling. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core functionality of this application includes depositing and withdrawing funds from a bank account. A custom exception, `InsufficientFundsError`, is defined to handle scenarios where a withdrawal attempt exceeds the available account balance."

    "## **Project Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Define custom exception:** Start by defining a custom exception class named `InsufficientFundsError`. \n",
    "- This class will inherit from Python's built-in `Exception` class. The custom exception will be raised when a withdrawal request exceeds the account's current balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Implement BankAccount class:** Implement a `BankAccount` class with methods for depositing (`deposit`) and withdrawing (`withdraw`) funds. \n",
    "- The `withdraw` method will check if the account has sufficient funds. If not, it will raise the `InsufficientFundsError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Error handling:** Include error handling in the application to catch and respond to `InsufficientFundsError` appropriately."

    "This project showcases the power of custom exceptions in Python for creating robust and user-friendly applications. By defining and using custom exceptions, developers can control error handling with greater precision and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** The `BankAccount` class and `InsufficientFundsError` exception can be extended with additional functionality as needed, such as handling different types of transactions, implementing interest calculations, or integrating with a database for persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error messages:** Custom error messages can be provided to `InsufficientFundsError` to give more context about the failed withdrawal attempt, enhancing the user experience and debuggability of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing and validation:** Implementing unit tests to validate the behavior of the `BankAccount` class and the handling of `InsufficientFundsError` is recommended for more complex applications."
